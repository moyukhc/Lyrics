Tiger Masks

Do I look blue to you too
Cause I ain't, I'm waiting
I'm red with rage, I boil and wait
My day will come and I'll raise my rage

I don't forget, my memory runs deep
and I'm just waiting for the day I make you weep
Believe

Which Bose do you want me to be
The poet, the scholar, or the revolutionary?
The choice is yours

The foe of my friend is an enemy


I know you want to terminate us
But I'm not waiting for 
I'm not picking salt or dodging stones
Watch out, Imma throw some of my own

Go figure that hybrid vigor
Still got bigots tripping with hands on triggers
ham-fisted
Witness scared of losing their women
Might just take em

I'm a son of this land
I'll carry its ___ in my hand
But by filial bonds do not extend to y'all sons of bitches

I am not your negro
and I will haunt you

your fuckery blew all my plans out
my dad gone all high school to put bread on the table
I worked my way up to give back to him
now you're asking me to keep quiet and stand down? (keep my mouth shut)
nah, I'm ain't even started to stand out
I'm going to burn all your shit down
I'm going to make you regret even talking about handouts
Hands down I'm out to take you clowns to a beat down
I'm going make sure your grandkids grandkids feel let down
I'm going to scorched earth your whole fucking 
just like you did 30 million times on your way out

I'm fucking militant, I'm more fucking potent than any of you dilettantes
You have my attention and I'm pissed and focused and 
I've got more fire in my pinky than you have in an entire village, bitch
And Immabout to attila the hun all up in your shit

Born on third and thought you hit a triple
Why am I not surprised

why y'all care about making a difference all of a sudden
now that you can't get off the vicodin

mind your damn business before I start minding your business for you

racists tryna erase us
why not race us
razor, favor
my cause is righteous
my rage is frightful
my is an artifact

who builds your bridges?
who __ and does your dishes?
boo hoo, momma died from opioid addiction
where were the tears when crack was doing the killing?
all I hear is make America white again
