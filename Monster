As I sit here

I watch on helpless
As my darkness grows

It writhes and twists out
Out from behind my spine
It uncoils and unwinds,
A tall, thin shadow

I hear only in ballads, dirges, and lullabies
Minor keys gently wrap themselves around my body
And squeeze
And rob me of air
Until I sleep
Their sickening peals and screams
Will release
Release the shadow out from inside me

I made him
I raised him on greed and brimstone
Weaned him on hate and lies
Gave him burning coals for eyes
And bloodied and broken glass for teeth
I grew him claws of lust
Bright and glistening like envious rubies in the night
I dressed him in my shame and uncertainties
And armed him with my lost love and broken dreams
Now he grows big and strong
Soon he will overpower me
I guess that’s what I wanted in the end

Now he rocks back and forth in his cage
And howls at me
And bares his teeth
And bends the bars
And rattles his chains
And I am afraid

I fear for my mother and father
I fear for my sister
I fear for my brothers and my lovers and the countless others
I fear for these good people and this place
I fear for the rocks and the birds and the trees
I fear for the sky
I fear for the lovely moon bathe in white and cream
I fear for the sun and stars
I fear for me

For once I let him loose
Words will wilt beneath his fury
His hot breath will sweep away thought and deed
He will break mens’ backs with their pelas
His burning garnet eyes will erase everything
And leave only
Oblivion
And me
