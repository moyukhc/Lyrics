I feel old
I feel a thousand years of violence
Brew under my skin
I feel a thousand suns
A thousand and one daggers
Ready to erupt from within

I feel the silence
I feel how it weighs on me
How it buffets and plays on me
Like an oppressive haze that greeds
To choke and asphyxiate me

I must act, I must move
I must talk, I must choose
I must escape this toothed calm
Just the hush before the maelstrom

(A storm is coming)
(A storm is coming)
(A storm is coming)
(The ship is sinking)
I canâ€™t suffer to be Hamlet anymore
