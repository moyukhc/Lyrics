A good man died today
Just hold on and maybe we’ll be ok
Could have been pills or a length of rope
Or a cruel joke or monoxide smoke
It might be that we’ll never know
But after years of laughter and play
All while trying to keep the dark at bay
His bags all packed up in a fevered state
The genie unbottled himself, and just floated away

A good man died today
Just hold on close,
I hope we’ll be ok
