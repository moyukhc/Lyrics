I was blind and then you smiled
I was cold and then you lit me afire
We’re only here for a moment or two
So why don’t we try before we pass right through each other


Let love bloom like a flame
Up anew from the ashes, untamed
And the passion will blow it all away
But I’ll be the one who stays


Won’t you come over?
Put your head on my shoulder?
Won’t you stay with me?


I know you only see him right now
I could be better, I know it sounds contrived somehow
But if you let me light this fuse we can fly [away]
Wouldn’t you rather have wings than a weight?


Let love bloom like a flame
Up anew from the ashes, untamed
And the passion will blow it all away
But I’ll be the one who stays


Now I’m an animal learning to love these chains
These thousand-day war has burned out the floor but you remain
And all I can do is hope to weather the waves
And wait with breath bated for you to stay the day


Let love bloom like a flame
Up anew from the ashes, untamed
And the passion will blow it all away
But I’ll be the one who stays
