When I look in the mirror every morning I
Don't recognize the face that I see
But he stares right back and says that he's me
He is the I that will be
I am that which is lost and unseen


I...just I against I
Every day body against body
Mind against mind
Every day a sliver slipping out of sight
I'll be damned if I go without a fight
