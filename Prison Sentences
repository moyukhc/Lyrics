Prison Sentences

Don't mention
The pain and the tension
In the penitentiary
Or you're begging the question
Misogyny
And you could count your trangressions
On candid camera
But ignorance is a blessing
Besides, there's no telling how
Your constituents will take the news
Might as well just forget
Prison blues
