Why do we idolize
Things that shine so briefly in the sky?

Deep under water, waiting for the sun to shine
Dreams of my father
Keep me in line
Maybe mind over matter is too much to hope for
Maybe we're too tightly bound by these
Twisting, selfish helices
Like black hands reaching into the sky
Their thin fingers a forest of spires

[Chorus] 
In camouflage, camouflage
Under cover of darkness we wait
And sabotage, sabotage
Ourselves as we prevaricate
As the tide rolls out and the moon turns on
We dream of days as lions
But when we wake up to face the dawn
Our apathy binds us in irons
[Chorus]

We can only hope to escape if we shoot for the stars
But the emptiness of space is too dark
And we worry about reaching out too far
Only to be lost, only to fall apart

Remember
Misery is the meat on which we sharpen our teeth
If you can't bleed, why live to tell the tale?
What is an honest man without the cheat?
Who was Jonah without the whale?

[Chorus]
