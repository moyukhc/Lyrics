Another morning
Strikes without warning
And I
I was fine
Until it came

Another cog,
Just one more gear
Here I’ll grind
Just bide my time
On this wheel

[Chorus]
New skin
Fits so well

New sun
Beats down on my face
And I awake
To a new day
[Chorus]

Another morning
Another fucking day
And the more things change
The more they stay the same

Washed out to sea
I let the waves carry me
To some foreign shore
Never seen before
And I’ll be...reborn

[Chorus]

I feel the moon’s light
In the night time
Graced by her touch
I am born again

Her gaze is the weight
That stays the day
And her white fingers 
Gently touch my skin

I wake up to
A world turned blue
And I remember, she said
It’s not me, it’s you
