They tell me that I’m young
They tell me I have so much to see
There’s so much life out there to see
But I can’t shake
The feeling in my bones
The fear that follows me
I know day be day
Step by step
I’m dying
It’s a little fucked


Every day I wake up
And I’m just a little bit sorer
I’m just a little more worn out
My bones creak and warp
Under the weight of time
It adds more burdens day be day
To my mind
And each morning leaches out some more color from the world
Leaving just more in shades of grey


I know I should be revelling in my youth
But I assure you I can only focus
On growing older


I see myelf
As I wither and dry
Time sucks the life and love from me
And I am all too aware
Of my incredulity
As the pendulum swings
And the blackbird sing
And I die day by day
By day
By day
