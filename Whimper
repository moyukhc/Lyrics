I saw the greatest minds of my generation…
Scared, stupefied, sedated into listless oblivion
Roped, paralyzed, and pulverized
Doped by the dollar sign or soaked to the bone in lack thereof
Always one step forward for two steps back
Or running in circles chasing tails of delusions of grandeur.
I saw lost weeping masses, silent in their passion,
Listless guided rockets headed somewhere,
But nowhere at all.

I saw the greatest minds of my generation
Stifled and choked
Cohorts of disciples to cults of idols
Eager for paths more traveled
But each fork in the road more overgrown
And that made all the difference

I saw the shores of Detroit
Dry up and recede
And leave old blinded men crying over dying metal behemoths
Who finally stopped coughing soot
I saw robots invade and
Leave neutered, braying maniacs replaced unable to contemplate a future together.

I saw arrogant old stoats in ermine coats
Reminisce warmly of the decadence of Rome
And of regal British thrones
Festooned with jewels looted from the bones of the Ganges
Of the exploits of Cortes, Pizarro, and Co.
Of cotton-picking, hanging negros, and Jim Crow
Of caged Gilded Age canaries dying, singing lonely notes
To Rockefeller and Vanderbilt’s cold chuckles,
And laughed dark, throaty laughs
Knowing that when they go
They hadn’t stolen anything from the denuded land left behind
That instead it had all been given to them.

I saw pigs in a line howling at
Rabid dogs shaking tails
And the poor souls caught between unable to utter a word

I saw all these things and still I remained
Naked and afraid
Alone and ashamed
I saw all these things and I saw myself
Rejecting faith
Rejecting help
I saw the disease and it saw me
And I bared myself in my apathy
And it ground me away
Into just another layer of sediment
Lost in time
