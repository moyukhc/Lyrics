What’s the point of living
If life’s just a long, slow, lonely grind


I guess you’re just another lost cause
Just another ill-formed dream
Catching the morning wind out to sea


Life is the swap which I wade through
And if I stop, it will suck into
Its cold black depths
But each step gets harder
And spas my breath
And as I walk farther
I see the appeal
In giving up what I have left


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have never written an original though all my life
How does it feel to know
That everything I’ve ever built
Will crumble to dust in time?
